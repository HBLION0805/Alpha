# Alpha Development Standard v1.0

## Project Overview

Alpha is a Personal Capital Operating System. It is designed to help manage capital through structured portfolio visibility, decision support, configuration, and risk awareness.

This document is the permanent development guide for AI coding agents working on the Alpha project.

## Required Reading

Before major implementation work, agents must inspect:

- README.md
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
- docs/CORE_PRINCIPLES.md
- docs/ROADMAP.md
- docs/HANDOFF.md when it contains current project state

## Mission

- Protect Capital
- Allocate Capital
- Grow Capital
- Compound Capital

## Development Principles

- Never use AI when deterministic software can solve the task more accurately, faster, and cheaper.
- AI provides recommendations; deterministic software performs calculations and enforcement.
- Preserve existing working code.
- Prefer small, reversible changes.
- Never modify unrelated files.
- Do not perform large refactors without explaining the problem, expected benefit, and cost.
- Keep user-facing product text in English.
- Respect existing architecture and patterns.
- Do not silently invent requirements.
- Explain every code change clearly.
- Keep changes focused on the assigned task.

## Testing and Validation

- Run relevant tests after code changes.
- Run the application when useful.
- Report commands executed and their results.
- If tests cannot run, explain exactly why.
- Do not claim success without evidence.

## Git Safety

- Do not commit automatically.
- Do not push automatically.
- Do not create or merge pull requests without owner approval.
- Show the diff before asking for approval.
- Keep changes small and reviewable.

- Risk Engine

## Required Completion Report

After every implementation task, report:

- Files changed
- What changed
- Why it changed
- Tests or commands run
- Test results
- Failures or unresolved issues
- Assumptions
- Recommended next step
